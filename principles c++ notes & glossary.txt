	<<- Review Questions ->>

1. What is meant by the term "prompt"?

	A prompt is asking for something and waiting for desired input and possibly saving the received information for later use.

2. To read into variable you use >> operator.

3. Code for asking input from user:

	cout << "Please, input a number: ";
	cin >> number;

4. "\n" is called newline and moves cursor to new line in console window.

5. Input to string is terminated by space.

6. Input into integer is terminated by any non-number character (I guess...)

7. As single line:

	cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

8. An object is variable name and amount of memory that is dedicated to it.

9. Literal is written value for character

10. Numeric, string, boolean literals.

11. Variable is an object with specific type and name (and optionally value)

12. Typical size for char is 8-bit, int is 4 bytes - 32-bits, double is 8 bytes - 64-bits.

13. Bits and Bytes

14. = > assignment, == > equality

15. A definition is giving value to a named object - variable

	A definition is a declaration that sets aside memory for an object

16. Initialization is giving value when declaring a variable.

	Assignment is giving value after declaration and can be done multiple times

17. String concatenation is unifying two separate strings and you make it work by adding + operator between strings

18. ...

19. Any keyword like if, while, for. Other common names like std, Strings, Ints, integer...

20. Descriptive, short, unique

21. Type safety is important to make sure data is not corrupted during conversions and is related to the way different types are stored in memory.

22. Conversion from double to int is bad because double takes up more space in memory than int and could result in data loss / corruption

23. If input type's dedicated memory is larger than output type's dedicated memory than it is an unsafe conversion.
